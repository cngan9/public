Problem statement
Given the data set (below), here are the questions you need to answer.
1) Predict future values for that data set along with the corresponding confidence intervals,
and plot it on a chart, using any technique of your choice.
2) Why did you choose the technique that you did, and what other options did you
consider/discard and why?
3) How can the predictions be improved as new data comes in?
4) What steps need to be taken to deploy this model in production?
